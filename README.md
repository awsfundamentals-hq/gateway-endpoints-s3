# Gateway Endpoints for S3

ðŸ”‘ Securely Connecting to Managed Services like S3 from within VPCs

![Gateway Endpoints for S3 Demo](public/awsf/gateway-endpoints.gif)

## How it works

This project uses AWS Gateway Endpoints to securely connect to S3 from within a VPC.

## How to deploy

You can deploy the app to your AWS account by running the following command:

```bash
pnpmi i
npx sst deploy --stage dev
```

> **Important Note**: This project must be deployed to AWS using `npx sst deploy` and cannot be tested with `npx sst dev` in local development mode. The Lambda function requires AWS Gateway Endpoints which are only available in a deployed AWS environment.
